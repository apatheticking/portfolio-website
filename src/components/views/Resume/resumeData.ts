To give you a little bit of a background on myself I’ve completed a bachelors of software development from Seneca which helped me transition into a career in web accessibility. After spending a number of years in web accessibility I wanted to challenge myself and decided it was time for a change. I then enrolled at Lighthouse Labs to learn the basics of web development and worked on a number of personal projects. Since then I have applied what i’ve learned and my experience in software development, web accessibility and AODA guidelines into creating and maintaining progressive web apps."
